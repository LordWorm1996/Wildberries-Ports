Wildberries theme ports on applications I use, the theme was originally created by Gabo: https://github.com/gbgabo and can be found on www.wildberries.style website

Waybar, wofi and hyprlock were originally made by https://github.com/elifouts at https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles but were modified to match the wildberries style colors and my preferences

Zed was made with the help of an anonymous user that used the Official theme-importer script of the dev build of Zed that my computer could not build due to errors massive thanks to said user, further modifications were made as it was not perfect from the get-go as I needed to fix a few color inconsistencies
