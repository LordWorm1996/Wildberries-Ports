# Wildberries-Ports

Wildberries theme ports on applications I use, the theme was originally created by Gabo: https://github.com/gbgabo and can be found on www.wildberries.style website

Waybar, wofi and hyprlock were originally made by https://github.com/elifouts at https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles but were modified to match the wildberries style colors and my preferences
